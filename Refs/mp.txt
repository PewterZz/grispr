name: abnormal intestinal goblet cell morphology
def: "any structural anomaly of the glandular simple columnar epithelial cell found in the mucosal lining of the small and large intestine, whose primary function is to secrete gel-forming mucins, the major components of mucus; the goblet cell is a highly polarized unicellular exocrine gland with the nucleus and other organelles concentrated at the base of the cell; the remainder of the cell's cytoplasm is occupied by membrane-bound secretory granules containing mucin; the goblet shape is due to the mucus laden granules in the apical part expanding, causing that part of the cell to balloon; the apical plasma membrane projects microvilli to give an increased surface area for secretion" [CL:1000317, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblet_cell, MGI:anna]
